    Buffers fetch attempts and flushes to database in batches.

    This reduces SQLite write overhead by batching inserts. The buffer

    Trade-off: Max batch_size IDs could be lost on crash, but gap
    analysis can detect and retry missing IDs.

        batch_logger = BatchLogger(db, batch_size=50)
        batch_logger.log(2023, 1, 'found')
        batch_logger.log(2023, 2, 'not_found')
